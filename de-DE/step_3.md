<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">

You will create several sections of content for your mood board and can use a combination of text, images, or emojis.

Think about the sections you want to add. You could sketch your layout on paper if you prefer.
