## Design your mood board

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
<div style="flex-basis: 200px; flex-grow: 1; margin-right: 15px;">
In this step, you will decide on a topic for your mood board and choose a matching colour palette and fonts. You will also need to check that your palette has good colour contrast so that it is accessible.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
Your webpage should not contain any <span style="color: #0faeb0">**personal information**</span> that can reveal your identity and/or location. Be very careful about who you share personal information with.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;"><span style="color: #0faeb0">**Graphic designers, interior designers, industrial designers, photographers, user interface designers, and other creative artists**</span> use mood boards to visually illustrate the style they wish to pursue. Amateur and professional designers may use mood boards as an aid for more subjective purposes, such as how they want to decorate their bedroom or the vibe they want to convey through their fashion.

Your mood board will use a colour palette so that it looks appealing with colours that work well together.
