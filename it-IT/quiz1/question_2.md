You have been given some options for background and text colours to use in a project. Which one should you choose to ensure that the colours have a high contrast?

  --- feedback ---

  Yes, that's correct. The background and text colours have high contrast so that the text is easy to read. This is important for everybody but it's even more important for visually impaired users of the web.

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. The background and text colours don't have enough contrast, which makes the text harder to read. You could use a contrast checker to adjust the colours until the contrast is high enough.
