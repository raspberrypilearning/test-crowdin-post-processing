Not quite. Look closer at the classes used on each `<div>` element.

  --- /feedback ---

- ( )

![Two same sized `<div>` elements.](images/normal-normal.png){:width="400px"}

  --- feedback ---

Not quite. There is a class used that controls the size of each `<div>` element.

- (x) 

![A wide `<div>` then a narrow `<div>`.](images/wide-narrow.png){:width="400px"}

  --- feedback ---

That's right. This code creates two `<div>` elements with a dashed border. The first one is wide and the second one is narrow.
