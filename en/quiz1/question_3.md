The `rounded` class sets the `border-radius` of an element. Which HTML elements can you use the `rounded` class with?

--- choices ---

- ( ) `<section>` element

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. You can use the `rounded` class on `<section>` elements to create a section with rounded corners, but that's not all.

- ( ) `<div>` elements

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. You can use the `rounded` class on `<div>` elements to add rounded corners, but that's not all.

- ( ) `<img>` elements

  --- feedback ---

  Not quite. You can use the `rounded` class on `<img>` elements to create an image with rounded corners, but that's not all.

  --- /feedback ---

- (x) All of the above

  --- feedback ---

  Yes, that's correct. You can use the `rounded` class to set the `border-radius` on sections, images, and some other elements too. If you didn't use rounded corners in this project, you can try to use them in the next project.
